# CodeDay22FP

These are my notes from Anjana Vakil's presentation The Art of Functional Programming (Anjana Vakil, Tech Talk @ CodeDay Labs 2022).  I have copied her examples and added notes in the comments where I thought necessary.

Functional Programming (FP), a paradigm in which programs are made up of pure, stateless functions, is adored by many programmers for how easy it makes it to predict, test, and debug the behavior of the code we write. Although FP has an unfortunate reputation as an ivory-tower domain full of obscure jargon comprehensible only to those with PhDs in category theory, the core concepts are straightforward ideas all of us can understand, and even have fun learning! In this talk, we’ll create generative SVG art as a way to explore fundamental FP concepts such as recursion and function composition and tackle the practical challenges of FP in the real world, such as dealing with the tricky parts like side effects and randomness which don’t fit into the safe, sterile world of pure functions. By the end of the talk we’ll not only have the key concepts & techniques we need to start writing our own functional programs, we’ll have some pretty functional art to look at too!
